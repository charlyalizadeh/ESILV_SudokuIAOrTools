# SudokuIAOrTools
An IA to solve and play Sudoku with Google OrTools
There is a bug with the interface showing the Sudoku, when it starts it doesn't always shows the grid immediately. Hold any key will update the window and solve the problem. (It works now but I let this in case it doesn't work on your machine)
